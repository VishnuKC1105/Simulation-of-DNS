# Simulation-of-DNS using UDP socket
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

-There are 2 files Server.py and Client.py respectively, I've used python for implementing this program (as you can see .py extension).  

-Anaconda prompt is used here to run these files. 

p.s: You can use any compiler, I felt like anaconda is more reliable :)
